This is alpha compilation of original vasm package from http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/ for Win32 platform build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Communit Edition.

Since original vasm is based on makefile and VS isn't really supporting such compilation process some changes have been done in order to enable easy compilation on Windows without GNU or nmake.

The uploaded file is Debug version to help hunt potential bugs. 

USE IT AT OWN RISK. This is not even beta but alpha. You've been warned.

x64 directory contains native x64 Windows binaries.

What is missing: vbcc


For vasm users: CPU is jagrisc and SYNTAX is std. Nothing else is supported for now.
m68k version of vasm soon will be made available.
